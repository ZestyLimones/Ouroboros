## Our Inspiration

Is working 40 hours a week and going to school the same amount of time truly feasible or even healthy? Is the glorification of an 80 hour work week in our society the cause of these problems? ​

## Loop Reward System

- Anticipatory rewards​
- We created badges user can earn progress towards that can then be displayed publicly if they so choose.​
- Each time an activity is done it is logged to our users feed​
- The dopamine system is especially sensitive to "cues" that a reward is coming. If there is a small, specific cue that signifies that something is going to happen, that sets off our dopamine system. So when there is a sound (auditory cue) or a visual cue that a notification has arrived, that cue enhances the addictive effect. It's not the reward itself that keeps the dopamine loop going; it's the anticipation of the reward. -Phsycology today Susan Weinschenk Ph.D.​
- Motivation is why someone wants to do something. Motivation is what arouses and sustains action toward a desired goal. It gives purpose and direction to behaviour. Motivation can be in any form like reward, recognition, satisfaction, pleasure etc..​
- <strong>Intrinsic goals</strong> relate to yourself; your personal growth, health and relationships with yourself and others.
